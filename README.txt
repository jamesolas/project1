
Expense Reimbursement System

The Expense Reimbursement System (ERS) manages the process of reimbursing employees for expenses incurred while on company time. All employees can log in and submit requests for reimbursement and view their past tickets and pending requests. Managers can then log in and view all reimbursement requests and past history for all employees. These managers are authorized to approve and deny requests for expense reimbursements.


Roles / Responsibilities
    Created a web application for employees to submit expense reimbursements.
    Took about 3 weeks to build the application.
    Used servlets to transfer data between client interface and server.
    Designed database functionality in Java using Hibernate.
    Created the web interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
    Built a function for employees to submit expenses to the database.
    Used AJAX to display pending reimbursements from the database.
    Used PostgreSQL for the database.

	To use the web application, the user needs to go to a certain address(for example: http://localhost:8080/Project1). The server is currently off for displaying the application due to external interference.
